This repository holds the poster I presented at American Geophysical Union conference in San Francisco in the Fall of 2014. 

The project was part of an NSF funded Research Experience for Ungraduates during my senior year at Winona State University. 
I studied under Dr. Joel Norris of UC San Diego's Scripps Institution of Oceanography for 9 weeks where 
we investigated if Global Climate models had a global warming signature. The result was inconclusive as there was no obvious trend among compketing models 
in terms of low stratocummulus ccloud cover changes. 

Overall it was a remarkable experience to get introduced to Matlab and studying Climate Models and in general, presenting research to industry experts.

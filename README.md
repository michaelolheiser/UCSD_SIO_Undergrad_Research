This repository holds the poster I presented at American Geophysical Union conference in San Francisco in the Fall of 2014. 

The project was part of an NSF funded Research Experience for Undergraduates during my senior year at Winona State University. 
I studied under Dr. Joel Norris of UC San Diego's Scripps Institution of Oceanography for 9 weeks where 
we investigated if Global Climate models had a global warming signature. The result was inconclusive as there was no obvious trend among competing models 
in terms of low stratocummulus cloud cover changes. 

Overall it was a remarkable experience to get introduced to Matlab and studying Climate Models and presenting research at the 2014 AGU Fall Conference in San Francisco, CA.

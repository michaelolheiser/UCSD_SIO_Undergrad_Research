Undergraduate research at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, CA during the Summer of 2013
Under the supervision of Dr. Joel Norris' Climate research group, I compared cloud cover trends of 6 different climate models using Matlab. 
This research was presented in a poster session at the 2014 American Geophysical Union Fall Conference.

## Introduction
Low stratocumulus clouds have a net cooling effect on the earth. This is due to their thickness, which provides a high albedo to reflect solar radiation back to space, as well as their weak greenhouse effect.  
Low-level clouds are an important factor to consider for global climate change, but much uncertainty remains regarding cloud feedback and climate sensitivity.  
This is in part due to cloud processes occurring at a smaller scale than models can account for, and small changes in cloud amount can have climatic impacts.¹

## Objectives
We are interested to determine whether century-scale transient response is similar to equilibrium cloud response, and whether simulated cloud changes since ~1980 are similar to the transient cloud response.  

Although models produce various cloud responses, finding similar equilibrium and transient cloud change would indicate internal consistency of the model. Furthermore, if simulated cloud change since ~1980 resembles the transient cloud change, this would suggest that low-level cloud changes observed by satellites since 1984 may be in response to climate change rather than natural variability.

## Methods
This study looks at the cloud fraction output from six different CMIP5² climate models (CanESM2, HadGEM2, MIROC5, MIROC-ESM, MRI-GCM, MPI-ESM) to investigate how low-level clouds may respond to increasing CO₂.  

The simulations examined are:
- 1% CO₂ increase per year  
- 4× CO₂ equilibrium change  
- Historical radiative forcing from ~1980–2005  

Low-level cloud fraction data was obtained for cloud top pressure ≥ 680 hPa and optical thickness ≥ 0.3.  
Metrics used were mean cloud fraction and cloud fraction change per decade.  
The domain studied contains subtropical oceans within 30ºS–30ºN latitude where subsidence occurs.³  

More specifically, grid boxes were selected for each model if the long-term mean of vertical velocity at 700 hPa was positive (ω₇₀₀ > 0) for every month, and the monthly means were positive for at least 80% of the record.⁴  

Mean cloud fraction and cloud fraction change from simulations for 1% CO₂ increase per year and 4× CO₂ were correlated to see if a century-scale transient cloud response is similar to the equilibrium response. Both CO₂ simulations were then correlated with historical radiative forcing simulations.  

The 1% CO₂ and 4× CO₂ simulations run from an arbitrary year 0 to 140.  
Analysis is of the final 20 years.

## Results
- The global maps shown are two of the six models and two satellite records.⁵  
  X’s on the maps indicate grid boxes used (see Methods).  
- CanESM2 output is shown since it is the only model to show negative mean cloud fraction and negative cloud fraction change for all simulations.  
- MIROC-ESM is shown as it had the biggest difference between the historical and CO₂ simulations.  

---

## Discussion and Further Research
- Transient CO₂ response is similar to equilibrium response.  
- Historical radiative forcing simulations do not show the same response in transient or equilibrium CO₂ for most of the models; therefore, CO₂ alone is not responsible for low cloud change.  
- CanESM2 is the most consistent model, showing a decrease in low cloud fraction.  
- Based on the inconsistency between the six models, a low cloud response to climate change observed by satellites (1984–2009) is unlikely and mostly due to natural variability.  

---

## Conclusions
- More models and realizations (different initial conditions) could provide a more accurate conclusion to cloud response due to CO₂ forcing.  
- More models exist for total cloud amount. If low clouds are represented well enough by the dynamics of total cloud amount, then more data would be accessible for analysis.  
- Further analysis of each model’s natural variability is needed.
